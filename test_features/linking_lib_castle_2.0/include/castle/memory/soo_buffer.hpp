/**
 * @file soo_buffer.hpp
 * @brief Stores one object inside a fixed inline buffer with no heap allocation.
 *
 * Use this header when an object must live inside caller-owned storage whose capacity is known
 * at compile time. The buffer is aligned for both `T` and `T*`, never allocates dynamically,
 * and exposes raw lifetime management through construction and destruction of the contained
 * object. Callers must ensure the inline bytes always contain a live `T` before `get()` or the
 * destructor are used, and must observe the move-member caveats documented below.
 *
 * @code
 * castle::memory::soo_buffer<MyType> buffer(MyType(7U));
